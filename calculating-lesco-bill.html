<h1>Calculating Your LESCO Bill</h1>

<p>Understanding and calculating your electricity bill is essential for managing your household expenses efficiently. In Pakistan, the Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO) is responsible for supplying electricity to the Lahore region. To help you gain clarity on how LESCO calculates your bill, this article provides a comprehensive guide to the process.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Determining the Connection Type:</strong>
		<p>LESCO provides two types of connections: residential and commercial. Residential connections are for domestic use, while commercial connections are intended for businesses. The tariff rates and calculations may vary based on the type of connection you have.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Calculating Units Consumed:</strong>
		<p>Electricity usage is measured in units, and LESCO bills are based on the number of units consumed during a billing cycle. To calculate the units consumed, subtract the previous meter reading from the current meter reading. Your electricity meter displays the reading in kilowatt-hours (kWh).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Understanding Tariff Slabs:</strong>
		<p>LESCO applies different tariff slabs to determine the cost per unit based on the level of consumption. The tariff slabs typically include a fixed charge, a variable charge per unit, and additional surcharges or taxes, if applicable.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Residential Tariff Slabs:</strong>
		<p>LESCO's residential tariff slabs vary according to the number of units consumed during a billing cycle. The more units consumed, the higher the tariff rate per unit. Here is an example of the residential tariff slabs:
			<ul>
				<li>Up to 50 units: Base rate per unit (e.g., Rs. 10)</li>
				<li>51 to 100 units: Higher rate per unit (e.g., Rs. 15)</li>
				<li>101 to 200 units: Further increased rate per unit (e.g., Rs. 18)</li>
				<li>Above 200 units: Maximum rate per unit (e.g., Rs. 20)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Commercial Tariff Slabs:</strong>
		<p>For commercial connections, the tariff slabs are generally higher than those for residential connections. The rates are typically determined based on the type of business and its power requirements. Commercial customers should refer to LESCO's official website or contact their customer service for accurate tariff information.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Calculating the Bill Amount:</strong>
		<p>To calculate your LESCO bill, multiply the units consumed by the applicable tariff rates for each slab. For example, if you consumed 150 units and the tariff rates were Rs. 10, Rs. 15, and Rs. 18 for the respective slabs, the calculation would be as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>50 units x Rs. 10 = Rs. 500</li>
				<li>50 units x Rs. 15 = Rs. 750</li>
				<li>50 units x Rs. 18 = Rs. 900</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Total bill amount = Rs. 500 + Rs. 750 + Rs. 900 = Rs. 2,150</p>
		<p>Remember to consider any additional surcharges or taxes that might be applicable and add them to the total bill amount.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Billing Cycle and Due Dates:</strong>
		<p>LESCO follows a specific billing cycle, and the due date for bill payment is usually mentioned on the bill itself. It is essential to pay the bill within the given time to avoid late payment penalties or disconnection.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Meter Reading Discrepancies:</strong>
		<p>In case you notice any discrepancies in the meter reading or billing amount, promptly contact LESCO's customer service helpline or visit their nearest customer service center. They will assist you in resolving the issue and ensure accurate billing.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
